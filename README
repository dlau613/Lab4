# UCLA CS 111 Winter 2016
## Lab 4 - Synchronization

QUESTIONS 1.1:
Why does it take this many threads or iterations?
Why does a significantly smaller number of iterations so seldom fail?

QUESTIONS 1.2
Why does the average cost per operation drop with increasing iterations?
How do we know what the “correct” cost is?
Why are the --yield runs so much slower? Where is the extra time going?
Can we get valid timings if we are using --yield? How, or why not?

QUESTIONS 1.3
Why do all of the options perform similarly for low numbers of threads?
Why do the three protected operations slow down as the number of threads rises?
Why are spin-locks so expensive for large numbers of threads?
